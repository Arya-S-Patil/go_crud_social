Social Media Post CRUD API
This Go application provides a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for managing social media posts.

Features
Create: Create new posts with unique IDs.
Read: Retrieve existing posts by ID or get a list of all posts.
Update: Update existing posts by ID.
Delete: Delete existing posts by ID.

**I have used HTTP client Postman to send requests to the following endpoints:**
GET /posts: Get a list of all posts.
GET /posts/{id}: Get a specific post by ID.
POST /posts: Create a new post.
PUT /posts/{id}: Update an existing post by ID.
DELETE /posts/{id}: Delete a post by ID.
